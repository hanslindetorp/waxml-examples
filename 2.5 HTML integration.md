An easy way to connect HTML events to control WAXML is to use the HTML attributes (If you prefer Javascript, please refer to the [[Javascript API]]). WAXML can listen to any event on any HTML element and respond by triggering, stopping, or setting the value of a variable. The syntax is:

`data-waxml-[eventName]-[commandName]`

- eventName can be any event appropriate for the HTML element, e.g. click, mouseenter, mouseleave, loaded etc.
- commandName can be either trig, stop or set.

ex:

#### HTML
```HTML
<div data-waxml-mouseenter-trig="sound1" data-waxml-mouseleave-stop="sound1">Rollover Sound</button>
```

#### XML
```
<ObjectBasedAudio src="audio/sound1.mp3" trig="sound1" stop="sound1" />
```


It is also possible to set a variable using WAXML HTML attributes:

This example show how a button can turn on the audio by setting the variable "gain" to 1 (supposed it is configured to control the volume in WAXML) or from a slider controlling the volume between 0 (off) to 1 (on):

#### HTML
```HTML
<button data-waxml-click-set="gain=1">Turn on audio</button>
<input type="range" min="0" max="1" value="0" step="0.01" data-waxml-input-set="gain=this.value" />
```

#### XML
```XML
<GainNode gain="$gain" />
```
