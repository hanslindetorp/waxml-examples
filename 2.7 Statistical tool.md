WAXML can give a report on the number of each element type in the configuration. It's only available through the [[Javascript API]]Â and it consists of only getter: "statistics".

Ex:
Read the statistical report from WAXML and display the result in a text field.

```Javascript
Object.entries(waxml.statistics.elementCount).forEach(([nodeName, cnt]) => {
  console.log(nodeName, cnt]);
});
```
