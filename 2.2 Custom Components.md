# WebAudioXML (waxml)
## - Custom components. 
There are several custom components solving complex tasks in Waxml. Two examples are the ObjectBasedAudio for 3D-positioned audio and the AmbientAudio for smoothly looped audio, useful for background layers with ambient sounds. 

### A setup with one 3D-positioned audio file and one looped background audio file
```XML
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Audio>
  <ObjectBasedAudio src="sound.mp3" positionX="5" positionZ="-10" convolution="convolution.mp3" />
  <AmbientAudio src="ambience.mp3" />
</Audio>
```
